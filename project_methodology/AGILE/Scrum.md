1.1. Lesson - Agile and Scrum
Introduction



In the IT world, developers work within teams with others, and their main goal is to deliver the product to the client. It might not be obvious, but communication skills with other people are essential. Our goal is to finish the project at as low a cost as possible while our client is still satisfied with the results.

Before starting the project, we need to tell the client when we’ll be able to deliver the project and check whether we have enough resources to finish it in time. If not, we might have to employ more people or change the deadline.

Agile is a popular methodology or a set of rules that helps us deliver our product to the client. Moreover, it focuses on responding to possible changes. We want our clients to be satisfied, but it’s challenging to plan for every possible thing the product will require at the very beginning of the project.

With Agile, we can respond to changes the client wants during the development process, making it one of the most popular project management principles in the IT world.

While learning about Agile values and principles, we need to remember this is only a set of rules. We still need to apply them to our IT teams. Scrum is the most popular framework for using the Agile mindset. It provides multiple tools to help us work as efficiently as possible.

The word “scrum” is taken from rugby: scrummage is used to resume playing a match after a foul. It’s an analogy for moving forward as a team instead of passing down work in a sequential relay race.

In this lesson, we’ll learn about Scrum principles and how to apply them to our team. We’ll learn how to solve problems and essential Scrum roles and set up user stories and sprints using Scrum.



Manifesto for Agile Software Development

https://agilemanifesto.org/

We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.

Waterfall vs Agile
Waterfall
Analysis -> Design -> Implementation -> Testing -> Deployment -> Maintenance

Agile
Plan <-> Design <-> Build <-> Test <-> Review <-> Deploy

Waterfall example
Building a house

You create a full blueprint of the house before starting construction
You buld the foundation.
You build the walls.
You build the roof.
You do electrical and plumbing.
You do the interior design.
You move in.
Agile example
Building a house

You create a simple sketch of the house before starting construction
You build a small part of the foundation.
You build a small part of the walls.
You build a small part of the roof.
You do electrical and plumbing for that small part.
You do the interior design for that small part.
You move into that small part.
Must, should, could
Must: Essential features that are critical for the product's functionality.
Should: Important features that enhance the product but are not critical.
Could: Optional features that are nice to have but not necessary.
User stories
As a [role], I want [action] so that [result].
Example: As a user, I want to reset my password so that I can regain access to my account if I forget it.
Changes
Waterfall: Expensive
Agile: Cheap
Scrum
Roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team
Sprints: Tasks for the (week/month)
Tasks: What to do, estimated time, who does it
